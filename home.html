        I want to go home. It's nice to be at home. After all, you have an exotic pet, like a piece of beautiful
        wildlife that you've only seen from a distance, through the TV screen ... And now you can scratch the ear of
        a chinchilla yourself, play with a ferret or feed colorful aquarium fish - it's really fun! And even if the
        weather is bad outside, or you did not manage to meet friends - it's still interesting to you, and the day
        does not go wrong - after all, such beauty is at home ...
